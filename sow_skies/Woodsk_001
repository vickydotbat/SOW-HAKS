// Textures
// texture0 is the texture you see behind the clouds during night, if the star shader is enabled 
// the alpha layer of the texture will be used as a mask, so you can, for example, show the moon 
// during night 
texture0 ds_fsky

// texture1 is the texture that is drawn over the stars and clouds, useful for mountains for examples
// The alpha channel of the texture is used by the shader to know where to draw stars and clouds.
// if you don't want this, disable the skyborder shader in fst_sky or use a transparent texture like
// ds_alpha0 texture:
// texture1 ds_alpha0
